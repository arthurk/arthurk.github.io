        <h1>Managing Helm Charts with Helmfile</h1>
        <time datetime="2020-03-29">March 29, 2020</time>
        <p>
            In this blog post I'm going to show how <a href="https://github.com/roboll/helmfile">Helmfile</a> makes it easier
            to manage Helm charts and environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do this I'm going to walk through an example where at the beginning
            we install helm charts over the CLI using the <code>helm</code> command,
            and then refactor the code in steps to use the <code>helmfile</code> command instead.
        </p>
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>
            Our setup consists of 2 applications (backend and frontend) and Prometheus
            for metrics. We have helm charts for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Backend (custom chart)</li>
            <li>Frontend (custom chart)</li>
            <li>Prometheus (chart from the <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus">helm stable repo</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            which are deployed into these environments:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Development</li>
            <li>Staging</li>
            <li>Production</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The files are organized in this directory structure:
        </p>
<pre>
.
└── charts
   ├── backend
   │  ├── Chart.yaml
   │  ├── templates
   │  └── values-development.yaml
   │  └── values-staging.yaml
   │  └── values-production.yaml
   │  └── secrets-development.yaml
   │  └── secrets-staging.yaml
   │  └── secrets-production.yaml
   └── frontend
   │  ├── Chart.yaml
   │  ├── templates
   │  └── values-development.yaml
   │  └── values-staging.yaml
   │  └── values-production.yaml
   │  └── secrets-development.yaml
   │  └── secrets-staging.yaml
   │  └── secrets-production.yaml
   └── prometheus
      └── values-development.yaml
      └── values-staging.yaml
      └── values-production.yaml
</pre>
        <p>
            Each values-development.yaml, values-staging.yaml, values-production.yaml file
            contains values that are specific to that environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example the development environment only needs to deploy 1 replica of
            the backend while the staging and production environments need 3 replicas.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use <a href="https://github.com/fstech/helm-secrets">helm-secrets</a> to manage secrets.
            Each secrets file is encrypted and has to be manually decrypted before deploying the chart.
            After the deployment is done the decrypted file has to be deleted.
        </p>

        <h2>Installation and Upgrades</h2>
        <p>
            With the above setup we use the following commands to deploy
            (install/upgrade) the backend chart in the staging environment:
        </p>
<pre>
<span class="cmd">$</span> helm secrets dec ./charts/backend/secrets-backend.yaml
<span class="cmd">$</span> helm upgrade --install --atomic --cleanup-on-fail -f ./charts/backend/values-staging.yaml -f ./charts/backend/secrets-staging.yaml backend ./charts/backend
<span class="cmd">$</span> rm ./charts/backend/secrets-backend.yaml.dec
</pre>
        <p>
            We use the <code>helm upgrade</code> command with the <code>--install</code> flag to
            be able to install and upgrade charts with the same command.

            We also use the <code>--atomic</code> and <code>--cleanup-on-fail</code>
            flags to rollback changes in case a chart upgrade fails.
        </p>
        <p>
            To deploy the other charts we have to repeat the same commands (for the prometheus
            chart we can leave out the part that handles secrets).
        </p>
        <p>
            Now the problem is that it's hard to remember the exact commands to
            run when deploying a chart (especially when the upgrades are not very frequent).

            When multiple people are responsible for deployments it's also difficult to
            make sure the same commands are used. If, for example, the secrets were not
            decrypted beforehand it will lead to encrypted values being deployed and probably
            crash the application.
        </p>

        <h2>Writing Bash Scripts</h2>
        <p>
            To fix the issues mentioned above we can write bash scripts that execute
            the exact commands needed for a deployment.

            We create one script per environment in each chart directory which leads to the
            following directory tree for the backend chart:
        </p>
<pre>
.
└── charts
   ├── backend
      ├── Chart.yaml
      ├── templates/
      └── values-development.yaml
      └── values-staging.yaml
      └── values-production.yaml
      └── secrets-development.yaml
      └── secrets-staging.yaml
      └── secrets-production.yaml
      └── deploy-development.sh
      └── deploy-staging.sh
      └── deploy-production.sh
</pre>
        <p>
            When we want to deploy the backend chart in the staging environment
            we can run:
        </p>
<pre>
<span class="cmd">$</span> ./charts/backend/deploy-staging.sh
</pre>
        <p>
            This works fine for small environments like in the example above, but
            for larger environments with 15 or 20 charts it will lead to a lot of
            similar-looking bash scripts with large amounts of code duplication.
        </p>
        <p>
            Provisioning a new environment would mean that a new deploy script
            has to be created in each chart directory. If we have 15 charts
            that means we have to copy one of the existing deploy scripts 15 times
            and search/replace the contents to match the new environment name.
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid duplicating the same code over and over again we could consolidate
            all of our small deploy scripts into one large deploy script. But this comes
            with a cost: We have to spend time maintaining it, fixing bugs and possibly
            extend it to handle new environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point Helmfile comes in handy. Instead of writing our custom deploy
            script we can declare our environments in a YAML file and let it handle the
            deployment logic for us.
        </p>

        <h2>Using a Helmfile</h2>
        <p>
            Using the backend chart as an example we can write the following content
            into a <code>helmfile.yaml</code> file to manage the staging deployment:
        </p>

<pre>
releases:
- name: backend
  chart: charts/backend
  values:
  - charts/backend/values-staging.yaml
  secrets:
  - charts/backend/secrets-staging.yaml
</pre>

        <p>
            We can deploy the chart by running:
        </p>

        <pre><span class="cmd">$</span> helmfile sync</pre>
        <p>
            In the background Helmfile will run the same <code>helm upgrade --install ...</code> command as before.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that there's no need to manually decrypt secrets anymore as Helmfile has built-in
            support for helm-secrets.
            This means that any file that is listed under <code>secrets:</code> will automatically be decrypted
            and after the deployment is finished the decrypted file will automatically be removed.
        </p>


        <h2>Environments</h2>
        <p>
            The above example uses the <code>values-staging.yaml</code> file as chart
            values. To be able to use multiple environments we can list them under
            the <code>environments:</code> key at the beginning of the helmfile
            and then use the environment name as a variable in the release definition.
            The file would now look like this:
        </p>
<pre>
environments:
  development:
  staging:
  production:

releases:
- name: backend
  chart: charts/backend
  values:
  - charts/backend/values-{{ .Environment.Name }}.yaml
  secrets:
  - charts/backend/secrets-{{ .Environment.Name }}.yaml
</pre>
        <p>
            When deploying the chart we now have to use the <code>--environment/-e</code> option when
            executing the helmfile command:
        </p>

        <pre><span class="cmd">$</span> helmfile -e staging sync</pre>

        <p>
            We can now easily create new environments by listing them under
            <code>environments</code> instead of duplicating our bash scripts.
        </p>

        <h2>Templates</h2>
        <p>
            After adding all of our helm charts into the helmfile the file content
            would look like this:
        </p>
<pre>
environments:
  development:
  staging:
  production:

releases:
- name: backend
  chart: charts/backend
  values:
  - charts/backend/values-{{ .Environment.Name }}.yaml
  secrets:
  - charts/backend/secrets-{{ .Environment.Name }}.yaml

- name: frontend
  chart: charts/frontend
  values:
  - charts/frontend/values-{{ .Environment.Name }}.yaml
  secrets:
  - charts/frontend/secrets-{{ .Environment.Name }}.yaml

- name: prometheus
  chart: stable/prometheus
  version: 11.0.4
  values:
  - charts/prometheus/values-{{ .Environment.Name }}.yaml
</pre>
        <p>
            The same pattern (for values and secrets) is repeated for each release. While in the
            example above we only have 3 releases the pattern will continue for future additions and
            eventually lead to much duplicated code.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can avoid copy/pasting the release definitions by using Helmfile templates.
            A template is defined at the top of the file and then referenced in the release by using
            <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/yaml-anchors-960154027.html">YAML anchors</a>.
            This is our helmfile after using templates:
        </p>
<pre>
environments:
  development:
  staging:
  production:

templates:
  default: &amp;default
    chart: charts/{{`{{ .Release.Name }}`}}
    missingFileHandler: Warn
    values:
    - charts/{{`{{ .Release.Name }}`}}/values-{{ .Environment.Name }}.yaml
    secrets:
    - charts/{{`{{ .Release.Name }}`}}/secrets-{{ .Environment.Name }}.yaml

releases:
- name: backend
  &lt;&lt;: *default

- name: frontend
  &lt;&lt;: *default

- name: prometheus
  &lt;&lt;: *default
  # override the defaults since it's a remote chart
  chart: stable/prometheus
  version: 11.0.4
</pre>
        <p>
            We have removed much of the duplicated code from our helmfile and can
            now easily add new environments and releases.
        </p>

        <h2>Helm Defaults</h2>

        <p>
            We've previously used the the <code>--atomic</code> and <code>--cleanup-on-fail</code>
            options when deploying charts. To do the same when using Helmfile we just
            have to specify them under <code>helmDefaults</code>:
        </p>

<pre>
helmDefaults:
  atomic: true
  cleanupOnFail: true
</pre>

        <h2>Running Helmfile Commands</h2>
        <p>
            Here are a few examples of helmfile commands for common operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            To install or upgrade all charts in an environment (using staging as an example)
            we run:
        </p>
        <pre><span class="cmd">$</span> helmfile -e staging sync</pre>
        <p>
            If we just want to sync (meaning to install/upgrade) a single chart we can use selectors. This command
            will sync the backend chart in the staging environment with our local values:
        </p>
        <pre><span class="cmd">$</span> helmfile -e staging -l name=backend sync</pre>
        <p>
            To show the changes an operation would perform on a cluster without
            actually applying them we can run the following command (requires the
            <a href="https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff">helm-diff</a> plugin):
        </p>

        <pre><span class="cmd">$</span> helmfile -e staging -l name=prometheus diff</pre>

        <h2>Full Example Code</h2>
        <p>
            This is the final content of our helmfile.yaml file:
        </p>
<pre>
